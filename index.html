              Today I ended up thinking a lot about something bothering me at my
              day job: <br /><br />

              At the end of each sprint iteration, there is always a point of no
              return from a timing point of view. It is then, when according to
              the literature, one sits back and looks proudly at the marvellous
              beauty of the produced deliverables. It is also then, when someone
              in charge declares an end-of-code state. Again according to the
              literature this is something like an imperative "pencils down"
              command, which every team member should follow directly. No coding
              and/or mad typing should result after the issuing of said command
              and yet somehow in my professional experience so far the most
              crazy, unbelievable and overwhelming coding results in exactly
              this time.<br /><br />

              So this is the reason for the name of this place - a virtual
              salute to a modern day oxymoron of my life as a man powered coding
              machine.
