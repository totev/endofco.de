It's amazing how much better you feel once you've given up hope.

                    Today I ended up thinking a lot about something bothering me at my day job: At the end of each sprint iteration, there is
                    always a point of no return from a timing point of view. It is then, when according to the literature,
                    one sits back and looks proudly at the marvellous beauty of the produced deliverables. It is also then,
                    when someone in charge declares an end-of-code state. Again according to the literature this is something
                    like an imperative "pencils down" command, which every team member should follow directly. No coding
                    and/or mad typing should result after the issuing of said command and yet somehow in my professional
                    experience so far the most crazy, unbelievable and overwhelming coding results in exactly this time.
                    So this is the reason for the name of this place - a virtual salute to a modern day oxymoron of my life
                    as a man powered coding machine.
